    "2. how would you describe, using the Kendall-Lee notation, a system in which package arrive at regular times, e.g., one every 5 seconds, they are checked by 4 customer service representatives (CSR) that take a random time to verify their contents (this time may be assumed exponentially distributed with mean η > 0, and the CSR do not communicate).
