    "2. how would you describe, using the Kendall-Lee notation, a system in which package arrive at regular times, e.g., one every 5 seconds, they are checked by 4 customer service representatives (CSR) that take a random time to verify their contents (this time may be assumed exponentially distributed with mean η > 0, and the CSR do not communicate). Every now and then, packages arrive with a red tag; red-tagged packages are immediately opened by any of the four CSR. The maximum line capacity is of one hundred packaged, and they arrive from the whole world\n",
